winkube.title=Welcome to WinKube
winkube.desc=WinKube is a simple kubernetes installer for \
		Windows that allows to use your existing windows machines to \
		build up a dynamic and fully automated Kubernetes Cluster. The cluster will start automatically and join the \
		cluster on startup and leave the cluster on shutdown. Additionally it will relocate any work done \
		if a certain CPU treshold is exceeded.
winkube.desc2=This UI helps to setup your WinKube node.
action.start-setup.label=Start Setup

# step 1
winkube.setup.step1.title=WinKube Setup - Step 1
setup-masterselect.label=Please select your setup variant.
setup-newcluster.label=Create a new Cluster
setup-joincluster.label=Join an existing Cluster
cluster-create.label=Configure a new Cluster
cluster-join.label=Join an existing Cluster
winkube.setup1.info=Do you want to configure and setup a new cluster? In this case this node must be configured as master\
			node and will manage your cluster settings. You can configure and add additional master nodes as well  \
		    later, but the cluster configuration cannot be changed anymore.
action.continue-to-step-2.label=Continue to step 2

action.back-to-step-1.label=Back to step 1

network-basic-setup.label=Basic Network Setup
upnp.description=WinKube uses the UPnP protocol for locating\
		other nodes in your network by default, which relies on multicast being enabled in your local\
		network. If multicast is not supported you will have to explicitly propvider the\
		master IPs for your worker and monitor configurations.
multicast-enabled.label=Multicast enabled
upnp.alternative.description=WinKube, by default, advertizes its clusters \
		using the UPnP protocol. If UPnP/multicast is not supported in your network \
		you must enter one of the master''s IP, which is:\
		<ul>\
		<li>the corresponding physical host name/IP, if <b>NAT</b> based networking is used.</li>\
		<li>the corresponding bridged network name/IP, if <b>Bridge</b> based networking is used.</li>\
		</ul>
upnp.port.label=UPnP port used (default 1900)
masters.label=Master Nodes
masters.placeholder=Enter your master node IPs
masters.help=Multiple nodes can be added, separated by comma
cluster-choose.label=Choose one of the existing clusters
update-clusters.label=Update Cluster List..
interface.label=For your master node to be locatable on  \
		your network choose the target interface/IP your master\
		node should listen to select the IP/interface
cluster-config.label=Cluster Configuration
cluster-id.description=WinKube can setup mmultiple virtual  \
		clusters on top of one physical network layer. So you must define a \
		unique ClusterID. You can also setup your own credentials to secure your cluster. If ommitted WinKube \
		generates default cluster credentials for you.
cluster-id.label=Cluster ID
cluster-id.placeholder=Enter the unique Cluster ID
cluster-id.help=The ID can be any text but cannot be changed anymore later
cluster-credentials.label=Cluster Credentials
cluster-credentials.placeholder=Enter the Cluster Credentials
cluster-credentials.help=Cluster credentials can be ommitted. In this case new nodes can automatically join a cluster \
		without any firther constraints.
cluster-cidr.label=Pod Network CIDR);
cluster-cidr.placeholder=Please enter the Cluster Network CIDR
cluster-cidr.help=The network CIDR used for the pod overlay network of the cluster.
network-vm-strategy.description=WinKube is able to run the Kubernetes Master/Worker nodes with different networking/VM \
        deployment strategies. Choose the one matching for you:
network-vm-strategy-bridged.label=Network Bridge
network-vm-strategy-bridged.help=VMs with network bridges  \
		running on their own bridge network (<b>default</b>) based on virtual network interfaces with their  \
		owne MAC-Adresses. If running in a company network this option may probably not be suitable for you
network-vm-strategy-nat.label=Lokales NAT Netzwerk auf dem Host
network-vm-strategy-nat.help=VMs with network bridges running  \
		in a hidden virtual network on the host. Incoming outside connections are routed via the host machine  \
		using Port-Mapping/Forwarding.
network-bridge-cidr.label=Bridged network CIDR
network-bridge-cidr.placeholder=Enter your bridget network CIDR, z.B. 192.168.10.0/24
network-bridge-cidr.help=Ensure the required host ports are  \
		unused (443 for master nodes, 10250,30000-32767 for worker nodes).
node-config.label=Node Configuration
node-config.description=By default WinKube manages the IP Pool  \
		automatically, but you also can define your own custom IP. Custom IPs must be \
		match the IP Pool spec or being publicly accessible.
node-ip.label=Explicit Node IP
node-ip.placeholder=Explicitly configure the node''s IP (optional)
node-ip.help=If unsure=leave this field empty.
node-type.label=Node Type:
node-master.label=Master
node-worker.label=Worker
node-monitor.label=Monitor only
